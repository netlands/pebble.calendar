Static Pebble Calendar with Japanese Holidays 

Based on the calendar app by [Jean-Noel_MATTERN](http://download.famillemattern.com/public/pebble/pebble-cal/); edited and compiled using [CloudPebble](https://cloudpebble.net/).

Note that all day and month names are in English as Pebble currently does not support Japanese characters.
